# Sky Wars Strength Alerts

When a player gets strength, their name is displayed for 5 seconds. Using commands, the player can configure the position of the text, the color of the text (including a chroma option), the speed of the chroma, or enable/disable the mod. Your settings are saved to a file created in your config folder.
